# Simple lexer + Parser for learning purpose

This repo is basically for leanrning fundamental basics of compiler based on the theory in the book **Compilers - Principles Techniques and Tools**. 

Nothing is useful here, just some code draft written during the learning.

I would use slow **NFA** to write tokenizer (or just write a direct one, we'll see) and simple **predictive parsing** method to write parser. Then, a generator backend to generate target in a subset of **3-addr code** in the book.
